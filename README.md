## neovim configuration

Intended to be used with nix. Can be installed with:
`nix profile install github:conorhk/vimrc`

Can be used in a nix shell with:
`nix shell github:conorhk/vimrc`

If you do not have nix installed and don't want to install it you can also use this config as-is. It supports native usage - just put it in your `~/.config/nvim` directory. You are responsible for ensuring that the right tools are on your system in order for LSPs/autocomplete/Treesitter to work though.
